== Overview

In this document, we outline the performance test plan for Arktos Scalability and performance comparision with Kubernetes
Community latest release version (currently 1.18). This test plan elaborates the environment setup, test tools, test suites,
and performance metrics we used to compare between Arktos and Kubernetes.

To ensure fair comparison between Arktos and Kubernetes, we will maintain the same setting during the tests:

- Same version of ETCD. For example, Kubernetes 1.18 is using ETCD 3.4.4, Arktos will be using ETCD comparable to 3.4.4. (In
the case of testing Arktos ETCD data partition, Arktos will use ETCD with minor customization from ETCD 3.4.4)
- Same number of API servers. In the case of testing Arktos API Server data partition, there will be multiple API servers. We
will use same number of API servers in comparable Kubernetes community version performance test. The differences are in Arktos,
the api servers are heterogenous, while in Kubernetes, those api servers are homogeneous.
- Same layout of components deployment. ETCD, API servers, Controller Managers, Schedulers, minions will have same hardware
configurations and virtual location, i.e., host colocation, network setup, etc.
- Scale out test follows the community guidelines:
. 99 percentile API calls within 1s
. 99 percentile pod startup time within 5s

This test plan covers an ongoing effort to periodically test and fine tuning the performance of Arktos based on industry benchmark
and Arktos scalability development goal.

=== Benchmark Tool

We use link:https://stupefied-goodall-e282f7.netlify.app/contributors/devel/kubemark-guide[kubemark] and link:https://github.com/futurewei-cloud/perf-tests[kubernetes perf-test]
to run performance test on Arktos and Kubernetes.

=== Setup on GCP
. Setup personal GCP account, ask it to be added into GCP project that have enough resource to start performance test.
. Setup your own dev machine in the GCP project. Install golang, docker, build-essential, and link:https://github.com/futurewei-cloud/arktos/blob/master/docs/setup-guide/setup-dev-env.md[other necessary tools]. Ensure your Google Cloud SDK is updated (suggested Google Cloud SDK 298.0.0 and up).
Please refer to link:https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/downloads-apt-get[installing with apt-get] or link:https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/downloads-versioned-archives[Installing from versioned archives]
to upgrade your google cloud SDK
. Ensure your docker login and access has been configured (sudo usermod -aG docker $USER), if not, please run "gcloud auth configure-docker" to config
. Git clone link:https://github.com/futurewei-cloud/arktos[arktos] and link:https://github.com/futurewei-cloud/perf-tests[perf-test tool]. Make sure perf-test folder is in src/k8s.io folder

=== Run the performance test
. Build arktos:
.. Go to Arktos source code folder: `cd ~/go/src/arktos`
.. Build Arktos: `make clean; make quick-release`
. Start kubemark:
.. Set env: `export MASTER_ROOT_DISK_SIZE=100GB MASTER_DISK_SIZE=200GB KUBE_GCE_ZONE=us-west2-b MASTER_SIZE=n1-highmem-32 NODE_SIZE=n1-highmem-8 NUM_NODES=8 NODE_DISK_SIZE=200GB KUBE_GCE_NETWORK=kubemark-500 GOPATH=$HOME/go KUBE_GCE_ENABLE_IP_ALIASES=true KUBE_GCE_PRIVATE_CLUSTER=true CREATE_CUSTOM_NETWORK=true KUBE_GCE_INSTANCE_PREFIX=kubemark-500 APISERVERS_EXTRA_NUM=0 PROMETHEUS_SCRAPE_ETCD=true ENABLE_PROMETHEUS_SERVER=true`
.. Start admin cluster: `./cluster/kube-up.sh`
.. Start kubemark cluster: `./test/kubemark/start-kubemark.sh`
.. Edit hollow node # (minimal 100 to run perf test) by updating "replicas: 10": `kubectl edit replicationcontroller hollow-node -n kubemark`
.. Wait for all hollow-nodes are ready (expecting replicas+2): `./cluster/kubectl.sh --kubeconfig=<path to kubeconfig.kubemark> get nodes | wc -l`
. Start perf test:
.. Go to perf-test source folder: `cd ~/go/src/k8s.io/perf-tests/clusterloader2/`
.. Set env: `export PROMETHEUS_SCRAPE_ETCD=true ENABLE_PROMETHEUS_SERVER=true APISERVERS_EXTRA_NUM=0 GOPATH=$HOME/go`
.. Run perf test: `nohup ./run-e2e.sh --nodes=500 --provider=kubemark --kubeconfig=<path to kubeconfig.kubemark> --report-dir=<folder to save report> --testconfig=testing/load/config.yaml --testconfig=testing/density/config.yaml --testoverrides=./testing/experiments/enable_prometheus_api_responsiveness.yaml --testoverrides=./testing/experiments/use_simple_latency_query.yaml`
. Shut down cluster
.. Make sure environment variables set up above still exist as GCP console consistently disconnect
.. In arktos folder, stop kubemark: `cd ~/go/src/arktos; ./test/kubemark/stop-kubemark.sh`
.. Shut down cluster: `./cluster/kube-down.sh`

== Performance Test Report (per formal release)
Note: can have separate page for performance comparsion each release. Here will host link to reports.

== Stability Improvement Plan
- Automated performance test pipeline: daily run for 100 or 500 nodes (depends on result reliability)
